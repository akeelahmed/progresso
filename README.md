# Progress

Progress is a Way to manage tasks.

It may seem a lot like [Trello](https://trello.com/), that's primarily
because it _is_ a Trello clone.

Create boards, add lists to the boards, and add cards to the lists.
Drag the lists and cards around to rearrange them, click things to edit them.

## Tech

Progress is a Backbone.js app built on top of a Rails API.
It uses GitHub OAuth for login.
