# Progress

Progress is a Way to manage tasks. It may seem a lot like 
[Trello](https://trello.com/), that's because it is a _rough_ 
clone of Trello. Minus some of the features.

Create boards, add lists to the boards, and add cards to the lists.
Drag the lists and cards around to rearrange them, mark cards as completed.

## Tech

Progress is a Backbone.js app built on top of a Rails API.
It uses GitHub OAuth for login.
